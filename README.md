 ## Development Setup
 Before you can start you have to configure the backend manually with a valid config-user.php
 
 Also you have to install Angular CLI globally using 
 ```bash
 npm install -g @angular/cli
 ```

 Then you have to install all dependencies using
 ```bash
 npm install
 ```

Finally you have to setup a pre-commit hook using
```bash
ln utils/pre-commit.hook .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

 ## Development Commands
 To run a development instance with the old api backend, change to the backend-legacy folder and start the backend in one terminal.
 ```bash
 cd backend-legacy
 php -S localhost:8000
 ```

To run the in development API, install Slim:
```bash
cd api
composer install
```

Then run it from the base directory as
```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t api/ api/index.php
```

 Afterwards you can run the development-server in another terminal using
 ```bash
 cd frontend
 npm start
 ```
 
 Then you can go to a browser and open http://localhost:4200

If you want to lint the project run
```bash
npm run lint
```
this command will also be in the provided commit hook so that it is impossible to commit code which does not pass the linter.
